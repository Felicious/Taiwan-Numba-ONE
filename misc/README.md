### antiquated script

My first version of the server-side script.

It mainly contains my love Derricku's code that he wrote for me to help get my project started. Also contains my scrubby non-idiomatic ways of writing Javascript and weird 2D array indexes.

I wanted to keep this nooby script as a cute vintage display of my skills. Perhaps looking at this script after completing this project

### help.md

Originally began as a place to save my bugs and their solutions, but I ended up just adding concepts I found useful/struggled with. I'll probably re-organize its contents after I finish this project (:

Additionally contains many of my love of my life Derricku's advice about coding. He info-dumps a plethora of wise coding knowledge that my plebeian brain is unable to digest in less than several sittings. Thus, I have made a habit to dump them here, so I can look back at them and (hopefully) understand it when reading it for the tenth time.

In particular, I look back on the project logic flow Derrick wrote as a response to a string of defuddled questions about my question. It is my compass, my North Star, **codified** law.

If you're curious what exactly that logic flow is, it's this:

1. User opens script web app [standalone scripts](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/standalone)
2. script reads spreadsheet -> data
3. data -> script generates html page from data -> html
4. html -> served to user
5. user downloads page

I wonder if `help.md` is just Derrick and my chat log now x:

Anyways, I love and appreciate you, Derrick <3
